write a readme.md file mentioning about the project in detail, and also mention the functionality it possess, every page details, and anything you find important. provide this seperately, no need to write in code

also, I do not liek the green color, make use of shades of cream color, creme, or bright colors,

the application is not responsive,and i want you to makt the Hotel management system for User interface mainly. so
add a footer that matches the application too.

make the application modern and stylish and user friendly. use some sort of lightweight pattern if and only if you think would be nice
reminding the application is User based application, with minor changes to switch to admin application based on logging user or admin.
